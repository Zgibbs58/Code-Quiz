# Code-Quiz
This a Coding Quiz that, once started, has a timer that starts running. As questions are answered, they are presented with another question. If they answer wrong, time will be subtracted from the clock. Once the time reaches 0 or they answer all the questions they will be presented with a score and an input to have their name and high score stored.
